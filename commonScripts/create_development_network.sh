echo "Purpose of this script:"
echo "- Enables cross-communication between independent docker-compose projects"
echo "- Allows containers like dev-environment to reach ollama on http://ollama:11434"
echo "- Required because docker-compose prefixes networks with project names (e.g., 'dev-image_${NETWORK_NAME}')"
echo "- Using 'external: true' in compose files bypasses this limitation"
echo "- Safe to run multiple times - creates network only once"
echo ""

echo "üìã Usage Pattern:"
echo "  - Run this script before starting any development containers"
echo "  - All docker-compose files reference: networks: development-network: {external: true}"
echo "  - Future service folders should follow the same pattern"
echo ""

echo "üîç To verify network:"
echo "  docker network inspect ${NETWORK_NAME}"
echo "  docker network ls | grep ${NETWORK_NAME}"
