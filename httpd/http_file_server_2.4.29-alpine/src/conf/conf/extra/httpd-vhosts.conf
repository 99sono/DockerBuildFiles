# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin 99sono@dummy-host.example.com
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
    
    # Grant access to everybody to navigate these file directories
    <Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs>
        Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Server name
    ServerName httpd.fileserver
    ServerAlias httpd.fileserver.7003

    # Log Configuration
    ErrorLog "/var/log/apache2/httpd_fileserver.error.log"
    CustomLog "/var/log/apache2/httpd_fileserver.access.log" common
