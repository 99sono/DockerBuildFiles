Thanks for the detailed explanation. Let's tackle your questions one by one:

1. **Additional Information**: You've provided a comprehensive overview, which is very helpful. If there's anything specific you think might be relevant, feel free to share, but I think we have a good starting point.

2. **Running the Model with Your GPU**: Your Quadro M2000M GPU supports CUDA, but it's an older model. The Hymba model requires CUDA 12.1 or 12.4, which should be compatible with your GPU as long as the drivers are up to date. Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed that support CUDA 12.1 or 12.4.

3. **Empty /usr/local/cuda Directory**: The PyTorch base image you're using doesn't come with CUDA pre-installed in the `/usr/local/cuda` directory, which is why you're encountering this issue. Here are the steps to resolve it:

   - **Install CUDA in the PyTorch Container**: You can manually install CUDA in your PyTorch container. Here's a Dockerfile snippet to help you get started:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM pytorch/pytorch:latest

     # Install CUDA
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
         cuda-12-1 \
         libcudnn8=8.4.1.50-1+cuda12.1 \
         libcudnn8-dev=8.4.1.50-1+cuda12.1

     # Set environment variables
     ENV PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
     ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
     ```

   - **Build and Run the Docker Image**: Save the above snippet as a Dockerfile and build your Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t pytorch-cuda .
     docker run --gpus all -it pytorch-cuda
     ```

   - **Verify CUDA Installation**: Inside the container, verify the CUDA installation:
     ```bash
     nvidia-smi
     nvcc --version
     ```

   - **Run the NVIDIA Setup Script**: Now, you should be able to run the NVIDIA setup script without encountering the missing CUDA directory issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up the Hymba model in your Docker container with the necessary CUDA support. Let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss!
