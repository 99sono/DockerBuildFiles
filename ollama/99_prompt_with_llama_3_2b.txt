Hello,

I'm trying to understand why my Docker machine doesn't seem to utilize 100% of the GPU. After thinking I've figured it out, please confirm.

To explain my situation: I'm running Windows 10 with WSL2 and hosting my Docker containers in the Ubuntu WSL2 environment. I have installed the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit as well as the NVIDIA container toolkit. My GPU is a Lenovo P50 laptop GPU, which is the Quadro M2000M by NVIDIA.

When I monitor GPU utilization using Task Manager on Windows, I never see the GPU reaching 100% utilization when running a chat prompt. However, in the bar chart summary, Compute_1 shows occasional activity up to 100%. The Compute_1 bar chart seems to be for a different graphics card than my own.

During inference, only the Copy and Compute_0 charts appear to be used. Here's my assumption:

* My software on Windows and Ubuntu is as optimized as it can be.
* My Docker Compose configuration is also as optimized as possible, with all resources available to the container.
* The reason for GPU utilization appearing low during inference is likely due to the way Task Manager calculates GPU utilization.

Task Manager considers not only GPU-specific workloads but also encoding, decoding, 3D charting, and other capabilities. Since AI inference typically uses a subset of these capabilities, the apparent low utilization makes sense.

Is this plausible to you? I'd appreciate your feedback and any additional insights you might have.

Here is my Docker Compose configuration for reference:
